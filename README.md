# Flask Chatbot

A simple chatbot built with Flask, allowing user interactions and storing conversation history using server-side sessions.

# How the Chatbot Works
When you type a message and click "Send," the message is sent to the server.

The server processes the message, checks for predefined responses, and returns the bot's reply.

Both the user's message and the bot's reply are stored in the session for persistence across interactions.
